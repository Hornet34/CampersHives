# CampersHives
My website showcases various campgrounds, giving users the ability to upload and edit content and post reviews.
I used the mapbox API to display maps of each campground, ensuring that users can easily see where each site is located.
To store images, I used Cloudinary, making it easy for users to access and manage their photos.
I utilized several technologies to build the website, including ejs, node js, express, javascript, and bootstrap.
